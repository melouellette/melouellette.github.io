<h3>PUBLICATIONS</h3>

<p>During my time at <i>Conservation Halton</i> I volunteered to write an article for the local Grindstone Magazine representing 
the Ecology department. The following year I had the opportunity once again to have another one of my articles 
published by the same magazine - this time to fulfill academic requirements for the Ecosystem Management 
Technologist program at Fleming College. The articles are listed below:</p>
<p><a class = "external" href="https://thegrindstone.ca/bearingsouth/">Bearing South</a> - Covers migration patterns of Black Bears in Ontario. Published October 17, 2018 in The Grindstone </p>
<p><a class = "external" href="https://thegrindstone.ca/bedroom-communities/">Bedroom Communities</a> - Covers the effects of Bedroom Communities on the environment. Published March 5, 2019 in The Grindstone </p>
