<h2> About Me </h2>

<img src="/images/ThunderBay2018.jpg" alt="Thunder Bay 2018" style= "width:384px;height:288px;">

<p>I am currently completing the <a class = "external" href="https://flemingcollege.ca/programs/geographic-information-systems-applications-specialist-online">
Geographic Information Systems - Application Specialist</a> program at Fleming College, and I am working towards completing my Bachelor of 
Science in Biology at Trent University part-time. In 2019, I graduated from the Ecosystem Management Technologist - Advanced Diploma program also 
offered at Fleming College.</p>
 
<p>My past work history has focussed mainly on terrestrial ecology and outreach. My most recent position as a Resource Management Technician for <i>Parks Canada</i>, 
allowed me to familiarize myself with Federal Recovery Strategies and policies for Species at Risk. Using available data records and ArcGIS,
 I updated the Action Plans for 85 Species at Risk within Trent Severn Waterway watershed. I also gained valuable work experience at <i>Conservation Halton</i> 
as the Terrestrial Monitoring and Outreach Assistant where I assisted in ecological field work and data collection in support of the 
Long-term Environmental Monitoring Program and Species at Risk recovery projects. This included such tasks as ecological inventories 
and sampling, and forest health monitoring. I also assisted stewardship staff with the delivery of outreach events, workshops and 
activities related to habitat creation and restoration.</p>

<p>Before returning to school, I spent six years working for West 49 
as the Assistant Store Manager, where I assisted with coaching, training, and motivating staff. This required excellent 
communication and teamwork through cooperation and adaptability to reach a common goal.</p> 

<p>I have also volunteered at various organizations, including <i>Oak Ridges Moraine Land Trust</i>, <i>Petawawa Research Forest</i>, and <i>Otonabeee Region
 Conservation Authority</i>. I successfully completed a Baseline Documentation Report for a Conservation Easement Agreement on behalf of Oak Ridges Moraine Land Trust. I performed a full Ecological Land Classification and created maps of the property including 
invasive species, previous violations, and the final ELC polygons.</p> 

<p>I possess excellent data management skills for the purposes of 
recording data collected in the field.  I have working knowledge of software programs such as Microsoft Office, Collector and ArcGIS for
 purposes such as entering and organizing data, compiling reports, and preparing presentations.</p>
